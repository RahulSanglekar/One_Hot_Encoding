# One_Hot_Encoding<br />
This is a problem in which we are required to train a model with some of the features as non-numeric:<br />
1) In the one_hot_encoding file we predict the price of a house with a given area and town <br />
2) In the problem file we predict the selling price of a car with a given age, car model and mileage<br />
